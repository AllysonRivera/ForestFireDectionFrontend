                    Every year wildfires destroy millions of acres ,
                  and the amount of destruction that these fires cause 
                  puts homes, infrastructures, businesses and our own 
                  health at risk. Due to the impact that these fires 
                  have companies have been looking for imporve first 
                  responders response time. Alert Wildfire is a company 
                  that has installed over 700 cameras in several locations
                   that are currently being monitored by volunteers. However, 
                   it is extremely difficult, and not reliable to have humans 
                   trying to monitor all these cameras therefore, by automating
                    this task, it can result in a more reliable detection of 
                    forest fires, which can allow first responders the chance 
                    to identify a fire faster. We built this website that uses 
                    a machine learning algroithm that we developed to detect the 
                    presence of fires on cameras from ALERT Wildfire. Signing up 
                    and loging in to this website will allow you to get notifications
                     when a camera has detected a fire. The alert will provide information 
                     such as the region of the camera, the name of the camera, a link to 
                     see live fotage of the camera. Next to the alert is a map that pinpoints the 
                     cameras location. We hope to imporve the response time to 
                     forest fires and provide useful information to help first responders.

                      For this project I primarily worked on the back end, collecting data, training models, and building an API to enable communication between the front end and back end.

                        For this porject I designed and developed the web application.
                        I also created the camera database and used GoogleAPI to show the cameras location.

                      As a data scientist, I primarily worked on the machine learning model used to detect fires in the ALERTWildfire camera feeds.

                      I am a senior studying Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering at CSUMB. 
                      I contributed to the project by connecting the live API to the frontend, enabling the system to generate fire alerts using a machine learning model. 
                      Additionally, I created the "About" section page, allowing users to modify their password and customize their location for personalized forest fire alerts.
